## Installation

Before installing pygame, you must check that Python is installed on your machine. To find out, open a command prompt (if you have Windows) or a terminal (if you have MacOS or Linux) and type this:

```bash
python --version
```
If a message such as "Python 3.8.10" appears, it means that Python is correctly installed. If an error message appears, it means that it is not installed yet. You must then go to the official website and follow the instructions.

Once Python is installed, you have to perform a final check: you have to see if pip is installed. Generally, pip is pre-installed with Python but we are never sure. Same as for Python, type the following command:

```bash
pip --version
```
If a message such as "pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)" appears, you are ready to install pygame! To install it, enter this command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
